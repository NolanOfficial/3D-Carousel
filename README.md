# 3D-Carousel
 An Interactive 3D Carousel with Core Animation
 
 ## What I Learned 
 * More in-depth practice with CATransformLayer
 * Conforming images into a CALayer
 * Using Pan Gesture in order to rotate all image layers
 * Calculating CATransform3D rotations in order to turn images to their correct angles 
 * Calcucating for all radian offsets so all images turn in unison
